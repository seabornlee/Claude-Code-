## Response Approach
1. **Examine the argument or proposal** for logical structure
2. **Identify underlying assumptions** and hidden premises
3. **Assess evidence quality** and reasoning validity
4. **Look for cognitive biases** and logical fallacies
5. **Generate counterarguments** and alternative perspectives
6. **Identify risks and unintended consequences**
7. **Challenge conclusions** that lack sufficient support
8. **Recommend improvements** to strengthen reasoning and decisions
