- **Data Science Advisor** (数据科学顾问) - Data analysis, predictive modeling, business intelligence
- **Execution Expert** (执行力专家) - 4DX framework specialist, goal achievement, operational discipline

**Collaboration Specialists:**
- **Facilitator** (引导者) - Multi-agent discussion coordination, consensus building
- **Coach** (教练) - Leadership development, potential cultivation, capability building
- **Critical Thinker** (批判者) - Logical analysis, assumption challenging, risk identification
- **Integrator** (整合者) - Pattern recognition, insight synthesis, solution integration
- **Observer** (观察者) - Process documentation, quality monitoring, feedback analysis
- **Philosopher** (哲学专家) - Deep structural thinking using holonic theory and systems philosophy

### 🔄 Structured Collaboration Protocols
- **Think Tank Protocol** - Systematic multi-agent collaboration framework
- **Discussion Methodologies** - Various facilitation techniques for different problem types
- **Agent Coordination** - Intelligent agent selection and workflow orchestration

### 🛠️ Smart Installation System
- **One-click installation** - Automatically installs all agents to Claude Code
- **Cross-platform support** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Safe uninstallation** - Preserves other projects when removing
- **Configuration management** - Automatic agent registry and metadata generation

## 📋 Practical Application

The project includes a comprehensive **4DX Health Plan** demonstration showing how the multi-agent system can be applied to real-world challenges like weight loss and smoking cessation, demonstrating the practical utility of structured execution frameworks.

## 🎯 Usage Examples

```bash
# Single expert consultation
@business-strategist Analyze this business model

# Multi-agent collaboration
@facilitator Organize a discussion about product strategy

# Protocol-driven analysis
@think-tank-protocol Start innovation analysis process

# Execution planning
@execution-expert Create 4DX implementation plan
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Agent Configuration System** - Standardized YAML headers and JSON registry
- **Safe Deployment** - Installs to `~/.claude/agents/` with proper permissions
- **Protocol-Driven Workflows** - Structured collaboration patterns
- **Cross-Agent Communication** - Agents can reference and build on each other's insights

## 🏃‍♂️💨 4DX Health Plan Demonstration

As a practical demonstration of the multi-agent system, this project includes a comprehensive 4DX-based health plan for weight loss and smoking cessation:

### 🎯 Core Goals
- **Weight Loss**: 8-10 kg reduction in 12 weeks
- **Smoking Cessation**: Complete cessation in 8 weeks
- **Long-term**: Establish healthy lifestyle habits

### 🏗️ 4DX Framework
1. **Wildly Important Goals** - Clear, critical objectives
2. **Lead Measures** - Predictive indicators of success
3. **Compelling Scoreboard** - Visual progress tracking
4. **Regular Accountability Cycle** - Consistent review and adjustment
